## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

Did this https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app course in order to get familiar with new Next.js features and revist "old friends"

Since I didn't wanted to host it in vercel, as suggested in the tutorial, instead of using postgres I made a local mqSQL enviroment, so some things regardind databases had to be adapted.
